# AI-Based Cheating Detection System for Online Exams üéìüîç


## Overview
Revolutionizing academic integrity in online exams, this AI-powered system detects cheating through **real-time head movement tracking** and **whisper/murmur detection**. Designed for institutions like Mekelle University, it addresses critical gaps in traditional proctoring tools by analyzing subtle behavioral cues often missed by conventional systems.

## Key Features üö®
- **Multi-Modal Detection**  
  - Head pose estimation & gaze tracking via computer vision  
  - Whisper/murmur detection using audio frequency analysis  
- **Real-Time Alerts**  
  Immediate notifications for suspicious activity during exams  
- **Ethiopian Exam Integration**  
  Optimized for GAT, Exit Exams, and university assessments  
- **Privacy-First Design**  
  Minimal data retention with encrypted streams

## How It Works ü§ñ
1. **Behavior Baseline**  
   Establishes normal movement/speech patterns during exam setup  
2. **Dual Analysis Streams**  
   - **Video Pipeline**: OpenCV + MediaPipe track facial landmarks  
   - **Audio Pipeline**: Librosa extracts voice features from microphone input  
3. **Anomaly Detection**  
   Machine learning models flag deviations (sudden head turns, low-volume speech)  
4. **Proctor Dashboard**  
   Visualizes alerts with blinking colors Red for cheating, Yellow for suspicious, and Green for normal behaviours.
